# Section 1: Intro: Cheating Our Way Past the Transistor


* FPGA
  * Field Programmable Gate Array
  * Programmable logic devices.
  * Array of programmable logic blocks configured "in field"
  * Built using transistors (lots of them - trillions!)
  * Look-up Tables (LUTs) store outputs for all possible inputs
  
* Hardware Description Languages (HDL) used to model electronic systems.

* Verilog describes circuits, meaning everything written translates to physical hardware gates.
